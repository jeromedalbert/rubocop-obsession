# Rubocop Obsession

A [RuboCop](https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop) extension that focuses on
higher-level concepts, like checking that code reads from
[top to bottom](lib/rubocop/cop/obsession/method_order.rb), or only unit
testing [public methods](lib/rubocop/cop/obsession/rspec/describe_public_method.rb).
There are some lower-level cops as well.

Use the provided cops as is, or as inspiration to build custom cops aligned
with your project's best practices.

Does your project have any cool custom cops that others might benefit from?
Then please open a PR!

## Installation

Install the gem:

```
gem install rubocop-obsession
```

Or add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubocop-obsession', require: false
```

and run `bundle install`.

## Usage

You need to tell Rubocop to load the Obsession extension. There are three ways
to do this:

### Rubocop configuration file

Put this into your `.rubocop.yml`.

```yaml
plugins: rubocop-obsession
```

Alternatively, use the following array notation when specifying multiple extensions.

```yaml
plugins:
  - rubocop-other-extension
  - rubocop-obsession
```

Now you can run `rubocop` and it will automatically load the Rubocop Obsession
cops together with the standard cops.

> [!NOTE]
> The plugin system is supported in RuboCop 1.72+. In earlier versions, use `require` instead of `plugins`.

### Command line

```bash
rubocop --plugin rubocop-obsession
```

### Rake task

```ruby
RuboCop::RakeTask.new do |task|
  task.plugins << 'rubocop-obsession'
end
```

## The cops

All cops are located under
[`lib/rubocop/cop/obsession`](lib/rubocop/cop/obsession), and contain examples
and documentation. Their default configuration is defined in
[`config/default.yml`](config/default.yml).

These cops are opinionated and can feel like too much, that is why some of them
are disabled by default. Do not hesitate to enable or disable them as needed.

I wrote them to scratch an itch I had at one point or another. Tastes change
with time, and I personally do not use some of them any more, but others might
find them useful.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
